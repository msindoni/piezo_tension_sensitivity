# Description

This code is used to determine membrane tension and analyze current responses  from expermnetal data generated via a combined differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy and pressure-clamp electrophysiology approach. These data can the be used to determine the tension sensitivity of force-gated ion channels.

# Image Analysis

## YOLOv8 training
- A YOLOv8 object detection model was trained on >1,500 Differential interference contrast microscopy (400x) images whereby the membrane dome was manually selected. The code for this training is provided in this repository as "training_code.py". This model can reliable detect the membrane done with confidence intervals at or greater then 0.7 as show by the training output below:

## Dependencies
Python 3.8.5 (other verison may work fine but it is not guaranteed)

## Installing the OGTC

git clone https://github.com/GrandlLab/OGTC.git

Virtual Envuronment: pip install -r requirements.txt

## Other Necessary Software

- **Micro-Manager**: This is an open-source software is used to control the microscope camera (Coolsnap EZ2) and can be downloaded at https://micro-manager.org/Download_Micro-Manager_Latest_Release

- **Arduino IDE**: This is an open-source software is used write and upload scripts to the Teensy 4.1 (code provided in the repository) and can be downloaded at https://www.arduino.cc/en/software


# Executing the Program

### Variables and Inputs

- **volts_per_bit**: slope of volts over bits calibration

- **volts_offset**: y-intercept of volts over bits calibration

- **bits_per_volt**: slope of bits over volts calibration

- **bits_offset**: y-intercept of volts over bits calibrationHEKA to teensy

- **command_voltage**: voltage program will begin at (0mmHg and 0V)

- **total_commanded_sweep_time**: total time you want each sweep to last; dictates how much rest will be given from sweep to sweep

- **target_tension_flex**: setting how flexible tension measurements from target tension can be before pressure is changed

- **hist_limits**: manually determining what the upper and lower bound on the pixel historgrams from the microscope images are

- **gaussian_column_num=2**: telling the OGTC program how many columns to skip when performing gaussian fitting

- **file_path**: file path to save images and end CSV

- **image_saving_frequency**: saving an image of the membrane and fit every x frames


# Program Output
- **protocol_data.csv**: a csv file containing all relevant data to the tension step protocol being executed. Descriptions for the data collected are below:

    - **monitor_bits**: bits being recorded by the Teensy 4.1. This value corresponds to the pressure that is present inside the patching pipette and is monitored by the high-speec pressure-clamp (HSPC) 

    - **command_bits**: bits being sent to the Teensy 4.1. This value corresponds to the pressure that is being commanded by the OGTC to the HSPC.

    - **monitor_pressure**: monitor_bits converted to the pressure (mmHg).

    - **target_tension**: tension being commanded for that step in the protocol.

    - **measured_tension**: tension that is present at the membrane.

    - **instant_radius**: calculated radius of the membrane dome for a single image.

    - **avg_radius**: calculated radius of the membrane dome for the five most recent images (not used for tension calculation).
    
    - **protocol_phase**: what phase the protocol is in (prepulse, pressure step, post pressure step).

    - **time**: total time the protocol has been running.

    - **sweep_time**: time for each individual tension step.

    - **on_off_heka**: recording if a voltage is being sent to the amplifier (1) or not (0). This is used as a timestamp for later analysis to timelock the start of the tension step to the electrophysiology recording.

    - **mem_fit_time**: times it takes for each individual loop in the OGTC program to occur.

- **fig_plot**: this variable in the code is associated with a JPG of the current DIC image with the membrane location in each pixel column (blue) and the circular fit (red) overlayed. An example image is shown below:
